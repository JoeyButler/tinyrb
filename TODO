TODOs (by priority)
===================
- attr_accessor
- array splat (eg.: name, *args = name_args)
- Run parser through tinyrb
- consts should be relative to current object (???)

Bootstrapping
=============
1) Builder parser and opcode emitter in Ruby
2) Pass parser and emitter through itself
3) inject opcode in vm and compile it
