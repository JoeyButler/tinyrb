= TinyRb

A tiny subset of Ruby with a Lua'esc VM.

Everything in TinyRb should run in the big Ruby.
(except bugs and things that don't comply to the principle of leas surprise.)
But not everything in the big Ruby should run in TinyRb.

This is a work in progress and not usable for "real things" yet.
See TODO for a couple of those things that need to be done.
