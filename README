= TinyRb

My lame attempt to copy tinypy and create tiny Ruby VM.

== Getting started

You need Ruby 1.9 installed as `ruby19` script (or change in vm/Rakefile).
Nothing interesting to do for now. To build the VM:

 cd vm
 rake
 ./vm

== Goals

- Learn inner working of the language we all love
- Keep it small so lots of people can understand it
- Fully bootstrapped
- Have fun!

== VM Bootstrap tactic

 boot.rb =(YARV instructions)=> boot.c =(gcc+vm.c)=> tinyrb => rich & famous

???
