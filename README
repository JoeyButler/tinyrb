= TinyRb

My lame attempt to copy tinypy and create a tiny Ruby VM.
I'm not a VM or language expert so expect the worst from this.

== Getting started

You need Ruby 1.9 installed as `ruby19` script (or change in vm/Rakefile).
Nothing interesting to do for now. To build the VM:

 rake
 ./vm/vm

== Goals

- Keep it small so lots of people can understand it (< 64K)
- Bootstrap (parer, emitter, etc in Ruby)
- Base on YARV instruction sequences (but use less)
- Have fun!

== VM Bootstrap tactic

 boot.rb =(YARV opcode)=> boot.c =(gcc+vm.c)=> tinyrb => rich & famous

See TODO
